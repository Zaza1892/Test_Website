E-commerce Website Project

A responsive e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I made this website as part of my class project , which asked us to demonstrate web development fundamentals.

The site connects to a mySQL database  to display products dynamically on the homepage. While the "Add to Cart" functionality is not yet fully implemented, the core structure for an online store is in place.
